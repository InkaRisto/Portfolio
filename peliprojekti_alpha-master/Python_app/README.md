#Experience

The second big project we had as our studies progressed was the assignment to take the game - *Lentopeli* - we had built before and turn that into a game that is functional through a web browser. 

Our team divided responsibilities between front and back end development and I was part of the **back end** team.
I ended up in charge of the building of the Flask application and towards the end also the biggest part in writing the JavaScript to make the Python code interact with the HTML page the front end developers had built.

My handprints can be seen in:
> - BS.js
> - airports.py
> - calculate.py
> - game_start.py
> - web_start.py
